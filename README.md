# 🛍️ E-commerce Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project, developed for a Machine Learning course in my 3rd-semester, focuses on **customer segmentation for an e-commerce clothing company**. The primary goal is to apply unsupervised machine learning to group customers into distinct clusters based on the data.

By identifying these customer segments, the company can move away from a one-size-fits-all marketing approach. Instead, it can develop targeted and suitable product promotions for each cluster, leading to more effective marketing campaigns, increased customer satisfaction, and higher sales. The project utilizes the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to achieve this segmentation.
